# IoT-Workshop

<b>Actual Step into the world of micro controllers</b>

#throwback 
After the covid lockdown got loosened , classes began to start in colleges. During the second semester of college, Our department conducted a hands-on workshop on IoT &  Arduino programming. It was mandatory for everyone to attend, some people attended it for 'activity points' but i was keenly interested and looking forward into something like for a very long period of time. Even though I've used arduinos & rasp pis before, i never coded on my own, so i was eager to study that.

Workshop started , instead of UNO they directly gave us ESP8266 to start with, because of these Arduino UNOs I've used before, i had some idea about how to interface with pc and all, but for the rest of the people it was a little hard to digest, Unlike the Arduino the pin numbers of ESP and the GPIO pin we've mention in the code is different for this node MCU. Whatever , this was the first time i was implementing the code on my own and trying out different things with these micro controllers.

This was some kind of project we've made... (when i say we i mean me). Using Node MCU to monitor the light intensity in the atmosphere , light some LEDs based on these values and upload the value obtained with the LDR sensor module in the "ThingSpeak" platform with an App created with "Blynk".
